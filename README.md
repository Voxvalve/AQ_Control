AQ_Control
==========

AQ_Control is an Arduino aquarium control system.



THE STORY:
--------------------------
It all started with me wanting something better then just a thermometer in each end og my 100cm long aquarium.
When i figured out how easy that was to do with an arduino i thought why not do more. 
also at this point there was alot of empty port on the Arduino UNO.
Then i figured that i might aswell do the light control with also.
After a while playing around with the date time stuff and having to set the time every time i flashed 
i went on amazon and ordered a DS1307 RCT to solve it(It works great!).
now i have all that sorted and i am currently testing the system.
So far everything seems to be working, Tempratures are read and displayed with great precision,
And lights are turned on/off at the specified time.
